## Handing in your thesis

* **presentation** : A folder containing both the original pptx as well as a pdf of your presentation.
* **videos** : A well-organized folder with all relevant videos and screencasts made during your project.
* **data** : A folder with all data needed to reproduce all of your results.

At the same time, bring all github repos you have been working with in order, that is, merge everything to master, ensuring that everything works, add a concise documentation on how to run your experiments, and add a git tag indicating the final version of your project.
